## Strategy Pattern ##

_The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it._

This project holds the implementation of strategy pattern. 

* Encapuslate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritence.
* Program to interfaces, not implementations.
