# Design_Pattern
I'm learning new design pattern in software development by following Head First Design Patterns Book by Elisabeth Freeman and Kathy Sierra, Thus repository holds the exercise and examples of the book.

## OO Principles
* Encapsulate what varies.
* Favor composition over inheritance.
* Program to interfaces, not implementations.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
